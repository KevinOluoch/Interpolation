# Introduction
This exercise has been done using R and PostgreSQl
The PostgreSQl steps are described below, while the R steps are documented in the R script.

The exercise has 3 parts: 	1) Creating a database user and databease table on the commandline,
							2) Interpolating the data in R and saving the interpolation surface (spatial Grid) in a database
							3) Exporting the database on the command line


1) Creating a database user and database table on the command prompt
	Assuming PostgreSQl is installed on a windows 10 computer
	Open the Command promt: 
		One way is by
			win key + shift 
			A 'run' dialoge pops up
			type 'cmd' as the name of the program to run and click 'OK'


	Move into the bin sub-directory in the PostgreSQl directory:
		cd C:/Program Files/PostgreSQl/12/bin
	
		NB: 12 is the PostgreSQl version number and may be a diffrent number.

	Assuming 'postgres' is the PostgreSQl super user, create a user called 'newuser1':

		createuser.exe --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --pwprompt newuser1

	Then, create a database with the command below

		createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres newdb1
	
	NB:  Enter superuser ('postgres' by default) password when prompted for a password

2) Interpolating the data in R and saving the interpolation surface (spatial Grid) in a database
	Load the '2020-07-21 - input data for test GeoSpatial Data Scientist' Rworkspace, 
	or load the 'Tests-for-GeoSpatial-Data-Scientist-master' Rproject.
	
	Then run the 'main.R' script.

3) Exporting the database on the command line
	Back to the command promt, while still in the PostgreSQl directory, run - You may change the outptut folder first.
		pg_dump -U postgres newdb1 > D:/newdb1.pgsql
